# Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets

## 1) Introduction

Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets: A Kaggle Challenge
Natural Language Processing (NLP)! ðŸŒŽðŸ”¥ This challenge provides an unparalleled opportunity to dive headfirst into the realm of NLP, offering a chance to harness the power of machine learning to distinguish between tweets that announce real disasters and those that do not.

ðŸŽ¯ Main Goal
The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying tweets into two categories:

Real Disaster Tweets - Tweets that report or are related to actual emergencies.
Non-Disaster Tweets - Tweets that may use disaster-related language metaphorically or in non-emergency contexts.


## 2) How to Install Tweet Classifier Application

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this project repository from GitHub
  
2. Install the required packages listed in the requirements.txt file using pip: pip install -r Requirements.txt


## 3) How to Run Tweet Classifier Application

After installing the required dependencies, follow these steps to run the application:

1. Open your preferred code editor and navigate to the project directory.

2. Open the terminal or command prompt.

3. Run the following command to start the Streamlit application: streamlit run app.py


## 4) How to Use Tweet Classifier Application


1) A welcome message on the home page. This page introduces the purpose and Click the Start button to proceed to the prediction functionality.

2) Using the Tweet Classifier:

On the prediction page, you'll find a text input field labeled "Provide your disaster tweet here".
Enter the text of the tweet you wish to classify. 
After entering the tweet, click the Predict Tweet button to submit your text for classification.

3) Viewing Your Results:

Once you've submitted a tweet for classification, the application will process it and display the results below the "Predict Tweet" button.
You'll see a message indicating whether the tweet is considered related to a disaster ("This Tweet is a Disaster") or not ("This Tweet is Not a Disaster").
